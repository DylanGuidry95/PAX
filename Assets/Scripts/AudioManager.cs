/*
    Problem: we faced 2D to 3D audio Clips
    Solution: So if one audio clip was 3D and the other two were 2D, the two audioclips will switch to 3D audio Clips
    Because they have all the same message, therefore, I guess 3D is MORE BETTER! It takes over.

    Problem: Change Audio Clips for the backgrund by Triggers
    Solution: When Tran heard of destroying scenes, she figured out by making prefabs for Audio
    When we make these Prefabs for Audio 
    Init Audio for Start Scene
    When switching, destroy Init Audio and switch to Game Background Audio and etc

    Problem: Keep playing AudioClips without cutting them off/resetting everytime they enter the trigger
    Solution: 3:22pm, we got nothing for now. BUT SPOON!
